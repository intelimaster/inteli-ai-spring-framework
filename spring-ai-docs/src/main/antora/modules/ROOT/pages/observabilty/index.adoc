= Observability

Spring AI builds upon the observability features in the Spring ecosystem to provide insights into AI-related operations.  Spring AI provides metrics and tracing capabilities for its core components: ChatClient (including Advisors), ChatModel, EmbeddingModel, ImageModel and VectorStore.

NOTE: Low cardinality keys will be added to metrics and traces, while high cardinality keys will only be added to traces.

.High Cardinality Keys
[cols="a,a"]
|===
|Name | Description
|`gen_ai.request.frequency_penalty` |The frequency penalty setting for the model request.

|`gen_ai.response.id` |The unique identifier for the AI response.
|`gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` |The number of tokens used in the model input (prompt).
|`gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` |The number of tokens used in the model output (completion).
|`gen_ai.usage.total_tokens` |The total number of tokens used in the model exchange.
|`gen_ai.prompt` |The full prompt sent to the model.
|`gen_ai.completion` |The full response received from the model.
|===

=== Chat prompt and completion data

The chat prompt and completion data are typically too big to be included in an observation as span attributes.
The preferred way to store large data it is as span events, which are supported by OpenTelemetry but not yet surfaced through the Micrometer APIs.
Spring AI supports storing these fields as events in OpenTelemetry and will provide a more general event based solution once the issue https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/5238 is resolved.

| Property | Description | Default
| `spring.ai.chat.observations.include-prompt` | `true` or `false` | `false`
| `spring.ai.chat.observations.include-completion` | `true` or `false` | `false`
